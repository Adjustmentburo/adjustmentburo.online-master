19 Laws"

Dear New Zealand Government,


In sequence to my letter to the UN Human Rights Committee, I would like to ask you a few questions regarding the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act and the Orders that have been made in accordance to this law.

I am sorry for any offence you might take by me asking these questions, a non-New Zealand citizen with no legal background. Please do not take anything into offence, nor take it personally. There are just a number of discrepancies in the Act and the Orders that seems to contradict and be led to suggest a different interpretation.

Let me start with the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act (PHRA for short). The entire law basically only states what ‘MAY’ be ordered, authorized, amended, required, and so on. (with a few exemptions) To my knowledge that means that, nothing is legally binding at that moment. The ‘may’ simply explains what could be made into an order. Nothing is ordered yet.

Please correct me if I got it wrong. 

All of the above also applies to the PHRA Air Border Order. There are several sections in that law, stating the same authorization, which the authorized person, ‘may’ be authorized to do, enforce, and so on.

For example;

> Authorisations of enforcement officers under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020
The Director-General may authorise suitably qualified and trained individuals to carry out any functions and powers as enforcement officers under section 18 of the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020. 
> 
> The Director-General has currently authorised three classes of persons as enforcement officers. Those classes of people are:
> 1.	WorkSafe inspectors
> 2.	Aviation Security officers
> 3.	Customs officers. 


This in fact only explains what the Director-General ‘may’ authorize. And it explains, in this case, who ‘enforcement officers under section 18’ would be. 

So in simple English, or as the Dutch would say, In Jip en Janneke taal.

This section still does not authorize anyone to enforce anything. It just explains, who would be given the authorization. It does not give any authorization. 

There is no legal dictionary that gives the word ‘may’ an absolute power. Also the ‘interpretation’ sections in the various Laws New Zealand has, do not define the word ‘may’ to a different meaning.

This is why I believe you are breaking your own law.

Kind Regards,
